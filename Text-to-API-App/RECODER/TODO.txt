Model "VoidType" explicitly

General
=======
There are 2 ways of computing member types - getMemberType() / computeAllMemberTypes() - check that!!!!

GENERAL:
o	- ReflectionImport (Annotations & Enums)
o	- TypeDeclaration.getMemberParent() - may also be method declaration now !!
o	- SourceInfo/Sourcerer/Annotations: Annotations are implemented as Expressions; how handle getType(Expression) in DefaultSourceInfo ?

Enums
o	- in switch/case, enum constant name must not be qualified (we allow that currently)

Generics
o	- do what if type args present but in URQ not toTypeReference, but something else? Exception?
o	- DefaultSourceInfo.getType(MethodReference) => TypeArgument(Info|Declaration)-resolving needs to be split up (?)
